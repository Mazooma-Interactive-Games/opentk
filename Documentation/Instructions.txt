=== Installation ===

OpenTK does not require installation. Simply decompress the archive to a folder of your choice.


=== Usage ===

Three simple steps:
1. copy "OpenTK.dll" and "OpenTK.dll.config" to your project folder. These can be found under Binaries/OpenTK/Release/

2. add "OpenTK.dll" to your project references.
(Right-click "References" -> "Add Reference" -> "Browse" and locate "OpenTK.dll")

3. set "OpenTK.dll.config" to be copied to your output directory.
(Right-click "OpenTK.dll.config" -> "Properties" and set "Copy to Output Directory" to "Copy Always".)

=== Build instructions ===

Double-click OpenTK.sln to build using Visual Studio 2010+, SharpDevelop 3.0+, MonoDevelop 2.0+ or Xamarin Studio.

You can also build from the commandline using:
(.Net)
msbuild OpenTK.sln /p:Configuration=Release
(Mono)
xbuild OpenTK.sln /p:Configuration=Release

The resulting binaries will be placed under the Binaries/OpenTK/[Release|Debug] folders.


=== Troubleshooting ===

When building with MonoDevelop you may encounter an issue regarding a missing “GlobalAssemblyInfo.cs” file. This file is normally generated as a pre-build event, via the “Build.UpdateVersion” project. There are two solutions to this issue:
1. Configure MonoDevelop to use xbuild as its build system.
2. Right-click and run “Build.UpdateVersion” manually.

Older versions of xbuild may produce the same error when building from the commandline. In that case, simply execute xbuild twice - the second run should succeed.
